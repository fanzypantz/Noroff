My JavaScript frameworks course assignment at Noroff frontend development. It is a little app for displaying the https://rawg.io/apidocs api data.


### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
